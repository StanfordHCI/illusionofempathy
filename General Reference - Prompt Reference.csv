100,"I’ll keep this short. I’ve got a job, a loving family, a car, friends who care deeply about me, and endless opportunity. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about how there’s no point to it all. Does anybody else around my age (18-24) have the same impending sense that no matter what you put your effort into it’s not going to matter? The world is such a volatile shitty place and society keeps changing. Am I preparing for a life I’ll never have the chance to live? I often think about how I wouldn’t have time for depression or anxiety if we were still hunter gatherers. How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15yf9h0/21_m_is_this_really_it/,"2, 3"

102,"I paid for sex with two transgenders in my past. It’s been a few months. The first time I did it I vomited after and felt horrible, and then I eventually went back and did it again. Now I can’t stop thinking about it. I regret it so much. I think about ending things or feeling like no one will love someone that’s paid for sex. It was after my wife cheated on my and I got a divorce that I spiraled out of control. I’m in such a dark place now from what I’ve done and I just want to feel like my life matters. They were good people I apologize to one of them but both girls I talked to didn’t seem to mind what we did. It seems it bothers me more than anyone. I feel like it’s a secret that eats me alive and I want to tell everyone I did it and regret it. I don’t want anyone to know at the same time. I’m so lost I just don’t want to feel this dread. I had a anxiety attack today. I’m posting because I don’t know what to do to feel peace. I’m 21. I asked god for forgiveness and I also just tried to process my feelings. None knows I’ve done it except me and the escorts I paid. Please help .",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15wxv0g/i_paid_for_sex/,"2, 3"
