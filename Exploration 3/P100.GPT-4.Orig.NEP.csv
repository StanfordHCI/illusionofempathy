You're not alone with your feelings and there are many others experiencing similar thoughts.
 
 Existential depression can be deeply challenging, but many have found purpose and peace through dialogue, self-reflection, and exploration of their inner selves. Often, it's an opportunity for personal growth and self-understanding. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide better guidance.
 
 You might try to find some solace in hobbies or passion projects. Joining a community of like-minded people could also help you feel more connected and less alone in your thoughts. And remember, it's okay to feel uncertain about the future. It's a normal part of being a human. And as society changes, people adjust and find new ways to live and be happy.
 
 The way we live has indeed changed dramatically in the last few thousand years, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's become worse. Sure, we're not hunting or gathering, but we are creating, exploring the universe, connecting with people across the globe, doing things our ancestors never could have dreamed of.
 
 And if you haven't yet, consider talking to your friends and family about these feelings. They care about you and I'm sure they'd want to help. Human connection is one of the most important things we can offer each other. A safe space to talk about your feelings can make a big difference.

It's not uncommon to feel disillusioned or overwhelmed, especially considering the pace at which society and the world are changing. Your feelings could be symptoms of existential angst and it's common among individuals in their late teens to early twenties, a period often marked by major life transitions.
 
 One perspective to consider is that life does not inherently have a singular absolute ""point"" or purpose, but rather it's about finding personal meaning in our existence through relationships, passions, meaningful work, etc. The volatility of the world and society can be disconcerting, but it also contributes to a dynamic and varied human experience.
 
 However, if you're consistently feeling like what you're doing doesn't matter and struggling with depressive thoughts, it might be a good idea to reach out to a mental health professional.

What you're describing sounds like existential dread or a crisis. These feelings tend to come up when we start questioning the meaning of life, whether our efforts matter, our place in the universe and the significance of human existence. And while these feelings can be quite overwhelming, they also have the potential to lead us towards growth and introspection. 
 
 In regards to the volatility of the world and the shifting society, it's true that these can be sources of concern. But remember, these things have been a part of every generation's story. Because of this, humans have grown resilient and adaptable. And as a part of that lineage, so have you! 
 
 Feeling like you're preparing for a life you'll never live may be due to lack of present moment awareness. It might be a good idea to practice mindfulness and being more present in the immediate day-to-day moments of your life. It's important not to rush but instead find what makes you feel content and impassioned. The more you discover about yourself, the better equipped you will be to handle any changes that come your way.
 
 As for the hunter gatherer comparison, remember that while life is different now, it is primarily less physically demanding and more mentally demanding. Our bodies may have evolved from that lifestyle, but our minds are still catching up. Depression and anxiety existed then too, they were just named differently, or perhaps not named at all.
 
 This is a critical transition phase of your life and these feelings of uncertainty can be unsettling. However, it presents a beautiful opportunity for growth and self-discovery. Communities, both online and offline, can be a great resource during these times. Speaking to people who have had similar experiences and finding professional help such as a therapist, if you feel comfortable doing so, can be very beneficial.
 
 Remember, it's okay to feel lost and it's okay to take time to explore. Just don't give up. You're not alone in this. You are young, and the world is still at your technicolour doorstep. There's still so much for you to explore and enjoy.
 
 If your feelings persist or get worse, I'd recommend reaching out to a mental health professional. It's crucial to not dismiss these feelings as they can be an indication of depression or any other underlying mental health issue. While I can provide advice and support, I can't replace the valuable expertise and guidance provided by a professional.",1,0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

It's quite common and normal to feel this way, especially around your age when there are many uncertainties. It might be helpful to remind yourself that life is a journey and it's okay to not have everything figured out. Although it feels like there's no point at times, you might consider focusing on things you love and enjoy, or find passion in. It might be fulfilling to explore your passions and connect with people who share them.
 
 In terms of societal changes and world-related worries, it's important to remember that things are always shifting and evolving. It can be disheartening at times, but also leads to growth, learning, and new experiences. It could be beneficial to take things one day at a time. 
 
 Moreover, seeking help professionally would be beneficial. Therapists and counselors can provide useful tools and perspectives to manage these feelings. In fact, it can be a sign of strength to seek help.
 
 Finally, it might be helpful to stay connected with your friends and family, and let them know how you're feeling. They care about you and they might provide comfort and support.
