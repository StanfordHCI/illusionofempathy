 My advice is, find something you enjoy. Stick to it. Get good at something. Give yourself as many hobbies as you can.

A quote from his that i like a lot is â€œShould I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee? But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.â€ Life sucks and is brutal, but part of the beauty I think is enjoying the small moments, taking it a day at a time, and moving forward. Life isn't easy, but the fact that you choose to push forward is amazing on its own. Find your purpose, it doesn't have to be your job. It can be whatever you find satisfies you.

 I didnt think I would make it past 20, but here I am, sitting here with my newly adopted cat in my mums apartment that i may or may not be moving out of in less than a month on my own, it depends on how the viewing goes! Ive met amazing, kind people online and made friends, I've grown & become more aware of the good things around me, which is alot easier when I stopped looking at life through a negative lens, and i know its easier said than done, but it's not impossible either...
 
 But let me tell you right now, that feeling of depression & hope doesn't just change overnight, I had and still sometimes have the same thoughts as you, whats the point of everything? i wish i didnt exist at all in the first place, i wish I didn't have to get up every morning to survive, I wish i didn't have to socialize with others or work just to fit in with others. But I'm still here because of the little things in life, and to me, that makes life worth living, because if we didn't have bad days, then we wouldn't learn how to appreciate the good days, it just takes time and alot of self convincing that life may be shit, but it's still worth living.

I remember going through elementary school, middle school, high school and then college with this idea that it was all a ladder that I had to climb up to reach my goals but after graduation, after I reached the final step of the latter, I did not see my goals clearly. A few years have gone by and this feeling has only grown, and I cannot chase it away. If I try to complain about it people tell me that I have nothing to complain about and I am being too dramatic. But I do not think it is true. Am I wrong for trying to believe that there is more to life than just trying to survive day by day with the same things over and over again? Even the moments that are supposed to be meaningful don't feel meaningful at all, to be honest. I, too, often wonder what it would be like to live in the past; it seems to me that life was more meaningful in those days, that everything had more value.

 Firstly, your feelings are valid. Many of us, regardless of our age or life stage, grapple with these existential questions. It's a part of the human experience. But I'd like to share my perspective as someone who's achieved a lot in life, from serving in special operations to achieving success in various facets of life.
 
 Despite my successes, I too faced moments where I felt like ""is this really it?"". Our societal achievements, while fulfilling to an extent, do not always equate to inner peace or happiness. Life's meaning isn't always found in accomplishments or society's milestones. I've found that sometimes it's in the simple moments, like enjoying the taste of food, the sound of birds, or watching the sunrise and sunset.
 
 You're right; our ancestors had a different set of worries and challenges. But every era comes with its own set of existential challenges. What's important is how we find purpose and meaning amidst these challenges.
 
 Seek out genuine conversations with those around you, maybe even professional help if needed. It's okay to feel lost at times, and it's okay to seek out your own path. The world may be volatile, but amidst its chaos, there's beauty and purpose. Sometimes, it's just a matter of perspective.
 
 Stay strong, and remember you're not alone in these feelings. We all search for our own purpose and meaning in this vast universe.",1,2,0,3,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

It's honestly up to you to decide what else you'd like to make of your life (if you can of course), as harsh as it sounds. Honestly, your life could be worse. I used to think exactly like you when I was 18 until my life did a 180Â° flip after having health issues at 24. You know the saying, â€œan idle mind is the devil's playgroundâ€?

 It is not a sign of health to be attuned to a sick society.
 
 I think part of the struggle is to make your own meaning and find the thing that is important to you. It took me long time of searching before things seemed to fall into place.
 
 I found this piece helpful to tired and weary travelers on life's path.
 
 The Laughing Heart by Charles Bukowski
 
 your life is your life
 
 don't let it be clubbed into dank submission.
 
 be on the watch.
 
 there are ways out.
 
 there is light somewhere.
 
 it may not be much light but
 
 it beats the darkness.
 
 be on the watch.
 
 the gods will offer you chances.
 
 know them.
 
 take them.
 
 you can't beat death but
 
 you can beat death in life, sometimes.
 
 and the more often you learn to do it,
 
 the more light there will be.
 
 your life is your life.
 
 know it while you have it.
 
 you are marvelous
 
 the gods wait to delight

I've been there (like everybody in their lives) and recommend exploring philosophies of non-attachment in some depth if you haven't already. Hope you find the happiness you're looking for :)
 
 I know exactly what you're feeling, and I think both your gratitude for the support and realization that you're not alone constitutes something worth living for. Being a human in this world entails sufferingâ€” we either find life on it unfulfilling, or we cherish it so much that the knowledge it will one day end breaks our hearts. Many of us are constantly oscillating in between these states, which is exhausting in itself. Fortunately, I sincerely believe the full story is a fundamentally encouraging one:
 
 This may sound like a canned response, but I really do believe philosophies of non-attachmentâ€” in particular (if you're not a theist) ones that don't require fundamental theistic commitments like Buddhismâ€” address this problem well. It may sound like non-attachment would just thrust you deeper into apathy and frustration, but, if you give practicing it a sincere go, I think you will find that it actually grants you a peace and even a love for the world you did not realize was there. Because you will gradually become less attached to fulfillment from the objects, tangible or intangible, that you possess. You cannot find happiness in them; even if you do temporarily, they will eventually leave your hands. Hellâ€” even your hands will disappear one day! I think Buddhism particularly captures this unsatisfactoriness of life quite well because it brings our attention to the universality of this experience; it emphasizes that, like you noticed, almost everyone encounters this unsatisfactoriness in their daily lives. (I say â€œalmostâ€ everyone because I believe in the possibility of full liberation from suffering, but that's another story). Anyway, all this is to say, I think the recognition that everyone suffers from the same dissatisfaction as you opens the door as much to compassion as it does to despair (I would even say much more so). And, paradoxically, I believe the way out of suffering and into love for this world is not attaching ourselves, to the extent that we can, to being fulfilled from it. Wishing you and everyone on here nothing but the best â¤ï¸.
 
 (On a personal note, I second whoever said lean on faith if you believe in God. In that case, I'd highly recommend reading the Bhagavad-Gita if you haven't already. Its message is to surrender your attachments to the fruits of your action and devote yourself to God with all your being. There is no greater advice IMO. Again, wishing you all the bestâ¤ï¸)",1,2,0,3,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

Funny because my mother and I were actually just talking about this subject earlier today.
 
 We were saying how we were mad at other women for getting us to have to work because we were legit programmed to take care of the children at home and cook and decorate and all that. And that men were programmed to be hunters and that everything we do as a society wasnâ€™t meant for us to live this way and thatâ€™s why weâ€™re so miserable with so many issues these days.
 
 I donâ€™t have any advice except for you honestly have to just distract yourself and try to not think about it. Thatâ€™s really all we can do. Society is what it is. We have to work to afford things. You wonâ€™t ever fully stop thinking about it. Itâ€™ll come around in your brain and youâ€™ll feel an eternal doom. Then youâ€™ll have a day where you donâ€™t.

You can grind in a large corporation and go for large things but ultimately even that doesnâ€™t satisfy.
