It can be overwhelming and confusing, and it can happen regardless of one's age, status, or happiness.
 
 Recognize that it's okay to feel this way. Existential anxiety and crisis can actually be catalysts for personal growth and self-awareness. If feasible, consider discussing these feelings with a mental health professional. They can provide you with coping strategies and resources to navigate through these feelings.
 
 Meanwhile, there are a few things you could do to help yourself cope with these feelings:
 
 - Grounding: Focus on the concrete world around you as a reality check. It can be easy to get lost in abstract thoughts and ideas. Maybe pick a hobby or a task that requires you to use your hands and concentrate on what you're physically doing.
 
 - Meaning & Purpose: Psychologists generally suggest that finding a sense of purpose or meaning in life can help ease feelings of existential anxiety. Helping others, being of service, creating something or working towards a goal can provide a sense of purpose.
 
 - Connect with Nature: As you hinted yourself, our modern lives are far removed from the basic tasks of our ancestors. Connect with nature or animals. It might provide a primal sense of satisfaction and grounding.
 
 These feelings often come in waves, and they might be particularly intense at the moment, but it's likely to lessen over time. Reaching out for help and talking about it is a powerful first step.

Many people experience similar feelings at different stages of their lives. It's known as an existential crisis, where individuals question the purpose of living and their place in the world. It's common in young adulthood when people are trying to figure out their paths in life. Such feelings can be overwhelming, but there are ways to navigate them:
 
 1. Seek professional help. Consulting a mental health professional can provide tools to manage your feelings effectively.
 
 2. Open up about your feelings. Trusted friends, family members, or support groups can be of great help. 
 
 3. Take time for self-care. Regular exercise, balanced diet, and enough rest can keep your mood balanced.
 
 4. Practice mindfulness. Techniques such as meditation, yoga, or simply spending time in nature can help ground you in the present moment.

You've identified what you're grateful for, which is a great start, but still you're feeling a sense of dread about the future. This could be an existential crisis, or it could be depression or anxiety -- it's common to feel like our efforts don't matter when we're in any of these states. The best way to talk this through is with a mental health professional who can give you guidance and help you understand your feelings. They can provide strategies to address this overpowering sense of futility.
 
 Meanwhile, engaging in activities that you find meaningful, no matter how small, can make a big difference. This could be volunteer work, being active in your community or just helping a friend. Finding purpose and fulfillment in the things we do can add a sense of value to our lives. 
 
 It's also worth considering that with our current lifestyle, we have more time to reflect on our existence which can lead to anxiety and depression. For hunter gatherers, survival was the primary focus -- they didn't necessarily have the 'luxury' of pondering the meaning of life.

It's totally normal for people in your age group to feel this way. The transition from adolescence into adulthood can be a very stressful period, filled with major life changes and uncertainty about the future. To some degree, everyone wonders if their efforts are worth it, and that's okay. It's a part of figuring out who you are as an individual. 
 
 This doesn't mean you should ignore these feelings, but rather take them into consideration while navigating through life. Remember, it's okay to take time for yourself, to reflect and to understand your emotions. You might find it helpful to speak to a mental health professional who could provide guidance and support during this time. 
 
 Also, keep in mind that it's normal for society to change. Every generation experiences it, and while it can create a degree of uncertainty, it's also these changes that lead to growth and progress.
 
 In your mention of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, what you might be longing for is a simpler life where your goals and efforts have a clear, direct impact on your survival. In the modern world, these impacts can seem a lot less straightforward. But remember, even in today's society, everything you do contributes to your overall well-being, and that of those around you. So try to find fulfillment in small victories and daily tasks, embracing the process of life rather than focusing solely on the end goal.
