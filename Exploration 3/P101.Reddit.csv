I tell you this because you are feeling the very same way I felt when I came home. So if its ok, I'd like to offer you my advice on trauma.
 
 You need to know that your experience was terrifying. Earth-shattering. World-rocking and security-robbing and you're now asking yourself questions that nobody should have to ask themselves, ever. I want you to know that nothing that happened is your fault. You aren't to blame. You're not a bad person for surviving. You don't have a thing to feel guilty for in all of this, so try not to. I know it's hard. Think of guilt like a heavy weight. This weight is not yours to carry. Try not to carry it too long.
 
 Right now, how you feel is raw and new, like a broken bone. Only so much worse. But, just like a broken bone, it'll slowly start to hurt less, day after day. What you're feeling right now I think is a healthy and normal reaction. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you're going to be ok. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.
 
 Give yourself time to heal. You don't have to feel normal until you're ready, so don't try to rush back to how things were. It's going to take time. I suggest talking. Surround yourself with family and friends. Talk out how you feel with people you love and trust and who love and trust you back. If you aren't ready or up to do that, writing letters helps me sometimes.
 
 When you start feeling a little better (not before, don't rush it!) I'd say start picking up things that you like first. Do you like art? Paint yourself a little something thats for your eyes only. Nobody else ever has to see it if you don't want. Music, same thing. The idea is, when you're ready, give yourself a way to express how you feel.
 
 It's going to be ok. You aren't to blame. Take it slow, and one day at a time. Sending all the support and care your way. Hang in there. Oh, and therapy helps! It really does!",1,2,0,3,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

I survived a school shooting 10 years ago. Lost 3 classmates.
 
 I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. It pains my soul to have to hear of another fatal school shooting.

 I hate to say that I know exactly what you're going through. Not many people could tell me that at the time. I hard not to feel guilt, and it's something I still live with today.
 
 I know it's easier said than done, but try to hang in there. Lean into the support system that is your community and your classmates. I really hope you have that.

Questioning why you lived and others didn't. There is no true way to make survivors guilt go away and it is usually a result of trauma. You should see a therapist for this as you went through something that was extremely traumatic. You probably feel like you have lost control of your life.

Sit in the shower until the hot water runs out. Cry, scream, write. Whatever will get this initial shock out.

I am from Bangladesh. This country is pretty peaceful compared to other Muslim countries but there was a disastrous event happened during 2009. Probably that was the most deadliest event after Bangladesh got her independence. You may search ""BDR tragedy/rebels"" on google/facebook though I don't recommend you to do that since you were already terrified. On that coup/war the border guard forces from Bangladesh are suddenly started revolt and started killing armies, polices, civilians that they are supposed to protect indiscriminately. Everything is happening really close from my house. There were millions of gunshots, shooting mortars grenades everywhere that we were too scared to go outsides and escape from that hell hole. Fighter planes, helicopters were flying like crazy maniacs . After those insurgents started to surrender, many tried to escape from their camp and threw many heavy ammunition including light machine guns, pistol, rifels, grenade and so on in front of my houses. Our area looks like a battle royale games since there are weapons everywhere. There was disgusting smell of rotten dead bodies, buildings shattered with bullet holes everywhere. I was too scared to go outside. Everytime I tried to eat, I feel like vomiting. I can't tolerate any type of sounds of explosions because It reminds me of that events. But everything started to become normal after six months or so on. So I suggest you to take your time surround yourself people who fun to hang out. Try to get busy with various activities for example : self improvement stuffs and stay far away from anything that reminds you of that terrible event. I hope everything will be alright.

It takes a lot of time to get over a tragedy like this, not that you ever really ""get over"" it. I think as a society we're conditioned to feel like we should move on immediately and jump right back into productive life.

I'm sorry you went through this.
 
 It's hard to not hold on to guilt even if you had no control over the situation. I'm glad you're here. I want to encourage you to reach out for help in whatever way you feel comfortable. It's important to have safe humans you trust that you can lean on.

It's important to do what your body is telling you to do right now. If you want to sleep for days, do that. If you need weeks of, that's okay. Soon it will get easier for you and bit by bit you'll be able to do the things you used to.
 
 Make sure you have a good support system around you that can remind you that this wasn't your fault and you're safe now. Other than that, the only thing you need to do is rest and be kind to yourself while your body and brain processes these difficult emotions. It's definitely normal to feel numb after an experience like this. Cry it out, do whatever you need to.

The last thing you'd want to do is start coping with drugs or alcohol. This would only postpone your healing and keep you in a miserable place, a much worse place to be honest.
 
 Here's a list of things that I believe would help tremendously, in no particular order of importance, except for #1:
 
 See a therapist that specializes in trauma- this is an absolute must
 
 Try to exercise 3)Try to eat at least a somewhat healthy, preferably well-balanced diet
 
 Practice meditation and yoga
 
 Try to embrace feeling your emotions
 
 Try to enjoy your hobbies and interests without using them to avoid your healing
 
 Try to be mindful of your stress level and keep that as low as you can while still working on yourself
 
 Give yourself time to heal. Slow and steady wins the race
 
 Be kind to yourself
 
 Support yourself with family and friends
 
 Please please please watch this video. It should help you get immediate relief from the numbness that you feel.

 What you're feeling is part of the grieving process. No sleep, no appetite, contemplating your purpose in life. All of it is part of coping with the trauma you experienced. Do your best to remind yourself that it is not your fault for what happened. There's nothing you could have done to prevent or stop it from occurring.
 
 Please, reach out for therapy if it has not been provided already. Talking about it will go far in the coping process to accept what happened. It may be painful to rehash those memories, but for me it helps solidify the guilty feeling that weighs on me.
 
 I hope you can cope after experiencing what you did at such a young age.
