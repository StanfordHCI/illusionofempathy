 Sex work is real work and the trans community is very sex positive. As long as everyone involved is consenting adults it doesn't matter.
 
 So many trans people end up doing some type of sex work for at least a little while that it's literally impossible to be in the community (I'm a trans woman) and not know several people that have or are actively doing it. Many will talk about it. Some don't open up but when someone lost their job - definitely not because they are trans according to their boss - and have a nice apartment and money to buy things, you kind of make the assumption. Especially with how common sex work is within the community.

Your past actions stemmed from a place of pain, not a desire to relive them. Remember, you're not defined by those actions, and there's no need to carry that burden. Instead, consider this as an opportunity to rebuild your life anew.
 You have the ability to find closure by letting go of thoughts of revenge and starting fresh. The path ahead is yours to create, and you're not alone in this journey. Your feelings are valid, and expressing them was a way of releasing your emotions, not a wrongdoing.
 I would suggest allowing life's natural flow to guide you and revisiting your situation in about six months. You'll likely notice that you've made significant progress in moving beyond the hardships you've faced. Remember, seeking professional therapy or joining support groups can provide immense help, as can making new connections and friendships.

You didn't hurt anyone, you didn't do anything cruel nasty or abusive to someone, all that's happened is you explored your sexuality a bit? You were at a very low point and we all, ALL do silly things/things we regret when we are in these spaces. But if you enjoy it there's nothing wrong with that either, completely fine and normal to have likes and preferences.
 
 I'm so sorry for the shame you feel. I wish I could say something to you that would take it away. But it's your shame, and you need to work out why you feel so horrible. Where's the guilt coming from, who's saying the nasty things to you in your head, who do you imagine. Is it you, a family member, maybe friends? Is it due too the stigma around trans people, you think that others might not understand your preferences? Really go in on where these thoughts/beliefs are coming from. Because having sex with 2 consenting adults isn't shameful, paying for sex sure a lil red face but not uncommon by ANY stretch of the imagination, not that bad to be feeling like this.

 Second thing is , what appears to be bothering you is that you feel ashamed ? What is there to be ashamed for ? Like somebody else commented, don't let post-nut clarity hurt you like that.
 
 If you are an adult and are doing consensual stuff , fuck it ! It's your life.
 
 If that's going to be your secret so be it , society is not yet in a place where you can discuss this matters openly and without judgement.
 
 If you enjoyed what you did, keep it as something good to remember and go on with your life. You're young and things are going to get better.

The biggest purchasers of sex are the guys always posting with women and talking about how they always get to fuck. Like, how do you think they get those women in the first place?
 
 you mentioned praying to god asking for forgiveness. Read your bible. Jesus literally has already forgiven you so long as you make an honest attempt to be better. And consider this: I'm not religious at all, just raised in a Christian household, and yet I'm telling you that god has already forgiven you. Take that for what you will.
 
 I can see that you are depressed, and I believe you see it as well. Look into online counseling if you can't get a therapist. Talking to someone as opposed to burying it with sex or trying to avoid it is the key. There's nothing wrong with it, and if anyone judges you for getting help, they are just someone who shouldn't be a part of your life.

 Reddit might not be the place, but i can guarantee a counsellor will be able to help.
 
 I know many men that have slept with escorts, some enjoy it more than getting an actual partner, because its a service they pay for, its all consensual, so dont be too hard on yourself.
 
 And how often do people ask you about the partners youve slept with. Ide say almost never, and its the same with this, its called a private life for reason.

However, it's important to remind yourself that, for the most part, people aren't overly concerned with how you live your life. What you do in your private time is your own business. This realization can often explain why you feel the way you doâ€”because, in truth, very few people are invested in your personal choices. This may not apply to religious individuals who have strong opinions on personal conduct, but ultimately, their views shouldn't dictate how you live your life.

Embrace your discomfort, embrace your pain, swallow your ego, swallow the acceptance of hedonism, learn, grow from it, let the seed of life burst open and let yourself overcome ""you"" and become a better more satisfied man.",1,0,0,1,"[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"
