Many people, especially young adults, experience a sense of existential uncertainty and the feeling that their efforts may not ultimately matter in the grand scheme of things. It's not uncommon for individuals to question the purpose and meaning of life, particularly when faced with a world that can seem volatile and challenging.
 
 The modern world is complex, and societal changes can contribute to feelings of unease and a lack of direction. Rapid advancements in technology, evolving social norms, and global issues can create a sense of uncertainty about the future and one's place in it.
 
 It's important to acknowledge that these thoughts and feelings are valid, and it's okay to grapple with them. However, it's also worth considering that the perspective of a simpler life, like that of hunter-gatherer societies, may not accurately reflect the full scope of human experiences or emotional well-being. While some aspects of living in a hunter-gatherer society might seem simpler, it's important to remember that they also faced their own unique challenges and hardships.
 
 If you're finding it difficult to cope with these thoughts, seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional can be beneficial. Sometimes, talking about your concerns with someone you trust or exploring these feelings in therapy can provide new insights and help you navigate these complex emotions.
 
 Remember that life is a journey, and finding purpose and meaning can be a deeply personal and ongoing process. It can help to focus on the things that bring you joy, the relationships that matter to you, and the opportunities that lie ahead. Taking small steps towards meaningful goals, connecting with others who share similar interests or concerns, and practicing self-care can all contribute to a sense of purpose and well-being.

 The feeling that our efforts might not matter in the grand scheme of things can be quite overwhelming.

Small positive changes can create a ripple effect and contribute to a better world, whether that's through personal relationships, community involvement, or pursuing meaningful work.

 Regarding your thoughts about hunter-gatherer societies, it's important to remember that life in those times also had its own set of challenges and difficulties.

It's essential to remember that these feelings are personal and can vary among individuals. While some people may resonate with your sentiments, others may find purpose and fulfillment in their endeavors.
 
 The idea of a simpler life as a hunter-gatherer may seem appealing when contrasted with the complexities of modern society. However, it's important to recognize that life as a hunter-gatherer had its own set of challenges and hardships. Meeting basic survival needs such as finding food and water were constant concerns, leaving little time for the kind of self-reflection and emotional introspection we have the privilege of engaging in today.
 
 It's crucial to acknowledge your feelings and thoughts and provide yourself with the space to explore them further. Consider seeking support from trusted friends, family, or even professional counselors who can help you navigate these existential questions. They can provide guidance and support as you explore your sense of purpose and find ways to make a positive impact in a complex world.
 
 Try to focus on finding meaning and fulfillment in activities that resonate with you personally.

 Firstly, it's important to recognize that your feelings are valid, and many people your age may face similar existential concerns. However, it's also essential to acknowledge that while the world has its challenges, there are also opportunities for growth, fulfillment, and positive change.
 
 Finding meaning in life is a deeply personal journey, and it often involves exploring your passions, values, and interests. Start by identifying what matters to you and what brings you joy or fulfillment. Consider pursuing activities, hobbies, or causes that align with your values and allow you to make a positive impact, even if it's on a small scale.
 
 It's also worth noting that comparing the present world to a hypothetical hunter-gatherer lifestyle can lead to an oversimplified perspective. While the demands of survival were more immediate in ancient times, modern society provides numerous advantages, such as healthcare, education, and access to information, that enhance our well-being and potential for personal growth.
 
 If you're feeling overwhelmed by negative emotions like depression or anxiety, it's important to seek support. Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional who can provide guidance and help you navigate these feelings.

 It's not uncommon to question the significance of your efforts and wonder if they will truly make a difference.

Cultivating gratitude for the positive aspects, such as your job, family, and friends who care about you, can help shift your perspective.
 
 Regarding your thoughts about hunter-gatherer societies, it's crucial to remember that societal conditions have changed significantly over time. Modern society presents unique challenges, but it also provides opportunities for personal growth, connection, and innovation.

 It's not uncommon to have existential thoughts and questions about the purpose and meaning of life, especially during times of uncertainty or when facing major life transitions. It's also normal to observe the world around you and feel overwhelmed by the challenges and unpredictability it presents. These feelings can be particularly intense during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood, as you navigate new responsibilities, choices, and expectations.

 It's normal to question the significance of our efforts and wonder about the future. With the rapid pace of change in society, it can be challenging to find stability and a sense of purpose. It's also understandable to romanticize simpler times and imagine how life might have been different in a different era.

 As humans, we have evolved in complex ways beyond being solely focused on survival. With advancements in society, we now have the opportunity to pursue personal growth, relationships, knowledge, and contribute to the well-being of others. It's natural to seek meaning and fulfillment in our lives, and often, this comes from finding a balance between personal aspirations and making a positive impact on the world around us. These pursuits can give our lives a sense of purpose and make them more meaningful, regardless of the ever-changing external circumstances.

Sometimes, it can take time to find your place and make a meaningful contribution, but the journey itself can be rewarding and fulfilling.
 
 Regarding your thoughts about hunter-gatherer societies, it's important to remember that comparing modern life to a hypothetical past can oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to mental health challenges today. While the lifestyle of hunter-gatherers may have entailed more immediate and tangible concerns, it's also worth noting that they faced their own unique set of difficulties and hardships.
 
 If you're finding it difficult to cope with these feelings of sadness, anxiety, or existential uncertainty, it's helpful to seek support from trusted friends, family members, or mental health professionals. They can provide guidance and help you navigate these emotions and find ways to live a more fulfilling life.

 It's worth noting that the world can indeed be challenging and volatile, and societal changes can be overwhelming. However, it's essential to find meaning and purpose in your own life, despite the external circumstances. While it may seem difficult to see the point of it all, focusing on the aspects that bring you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose can make a significant difference.
 
 If you find yourself questioning the purpose and meaning of your efforts, it might be helpful to explore different areas that interest you. Consider pursuing hobbies, passions, or activities that genuinely resonate with you. By investing time and energy into something that aligns with your values and aspirations, you can create a sense of purpose and derive personal satisfaction, regardless of the external uncertainties.
 
 Taking care of your mental health is also crucial. While it's true that the responsibilities and stressors of modern life can sometimes feel overwhelming, addressing feelings of depression or anxiety is important. If you find yourself struggling with such emotions, seeking support from a mental health professional can provide guidance and help you develop coping strategies.
 
 Remember, life can change in unexpected ways, and sometimes opportunities you never anticipated can arise. By staying open to new experiences and focusing on personal growth, you increase your chances of living a fulfilling life. Try to focus on the present moment and the things you have control over, as dwelling too much on an uncertain future can contribute to feelings of hopelessness.
 
 If you ever find it challenging to cope with these thoughts and feelings, confiding in a trusted friend or family member can also be beneficial. They may provide emotional support and offer their perspective on the challenges you're facing.

 It's not uncommon for people, regardless of age, to question the meaning and purpose of their lives. The feeling that our efforts may be insignificant or that the world is uncertain can be overwhelming. Changes in society and the challenges of the modern world can contribute to these feelings.
 
 It's important to recognize that everyone's journey is unique, and what matters is finding meaning and purpose that resonate with you personally. Sometimes these feelings can be a result of a lack of fulfillment or a misalignment between your values and your current path. Reflecting on your aspirations and passions might help you gain clarity and a sense of direction.
 
 Regarding your thoughts about life as a hunter-gatherer, it's worth considering that the modern world brings both advantages and challenges. While the conveniences of modern life can provide comfort, they can also create complexities and pressures that were absent in simpler times. Mental health issues can arise due to various factors, including genetic predisposition, life circumstances, and societal changes.
 
 If you find that these feelings persist and affect your well-being, it may be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional. They can provide support, guidance, and strategies to work through these emotions and help you find a sense of purpose and contentment.

How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?","I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I can assure you that you're not alone in experiencing such thoughts and emotions. Many people, especially in your age group, grapple with existential questions and a sense of uncertainty about the future. The rapid changes in our world, the challenges presented by society, and the constant exposure to negative news can contribute to a feeling of despair or nihilism.
 
 It's important to recognize that these emotions and thoughts are valid, and it's okay to question the meaning and purpose of life. However, it's also essential to find ways to navigate through these feelings and find a sense of meaning for yourself. Here are a few suggestions that might help:
 
 1. Seek connections: Maintain the relationships with your loving family and friends who care about you. Supporting and being supported by others can provide a sense of purpose and belonging.
 
 2. Engage in meaningful activities: Find activities or hobbies that genuinely interest you and bring you joy. Pursue your passions and invest time in things you find fulfilling, as these can provide a sense of purpose and meaning.
 
 3. Set realistic goals: Instead of focusing on the grand scheme of life, break it down into smaller, achievable goals. These goals can give you direction and a sense of accomplishment, helping to counteract the feeling that nothing matters.
 
 4. Take care of your well-being: Physical and mental well-being are crucial for a sense of fulfillment. Incorporate self-care activities into your routine, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, good sleep habits, and seeking professional help if needed.
 
 5. Find your values: Explore your personal values and what matters most to you. Align your choices and actions with those values, as this can help cultivate a sense of purpose and authenticity in your life.
 
 6. Focus on the present: While pondering the past and future can be valuable, try to ground yourself in the present moment. Practice mindfulness or meditation to develop awareness and reduce excessive worry about the past or future.
 
 Remember that seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can be immensely beneficial if you find it challenging to manage these thoughts and emotions on your own. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and help you develop strategies to cope with existential concerns.
 
 Finally, it's important to understand that idealizing the lives of hunter-gatherers may overlook the significant challenges they faced. While they had certain responsibilities that engaged their minds and bodies, their survival was often uncertain, and they had to face environmental hardships. Comparing our modern lives to theirs may not provide a complete perspective.
 
 Ultimately, finding meaning in life is a personal journey, and it may take time, exploration, and self-reflection.

 It's important to remember that these feelings and thoughts are subjective and can vary from person to person. While some individuals may share similar concerns, others may have a more optimistic outlook. Everyone's perspective is influenced by their unique experiences, circumstances, and personal beliefs.
 
 It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by the state of the world and its challenges. Rapid changes in society, coupled with the constant exposure to global issues through media, can contribute to a sense of hopelessness. However, it's important to recognize that your actions and efforts can still have an impact, both on a personal level and in the larger context of society.
 
 Finding a sense of purpose and meaning in life is a deeply personal journey. It might be helpful to reflect on your own values, interests, and passions. Consider setting goals that align with these aspects of your life and take actions to work towards them. While the world is indeed volatile, remember that change can also create new opportunities for growth and positive transformation.
 
 Regarding your thoughts about the simpler lifestyles of hunter-gatherer societies, it's important to recognize that romanticizing or idealizing the past isn't always an accurate reflection of reality.

Comparing the present to an imagined past can sometimes overlook the progress and advancements that have been made in areas such as technology, medicine, and quality of life.

 Many factors can contribute to these thoughts and emotions, including the rapidly changing nature of society, the overwhelming amount of information and global issues we're exposed to, and the pressure to make life-altering decisions during a time of great transition in your life.
 
 While it's natural to ponder the significance of your actions and the state of the world, it's important to remember that you have the power to shape your own life and find meaning in the things you value. Here are a few suggestions to help you navigate these feelings:
 
 1. Explore your passions: Take some time to reflect on what truly brings you joy and fulfillment. Engaging in activities that align with your interests and values can give you a sense of purpose and satisfaction, regardless of external uncertainties.
 
 2. Connect with others: Building and maintaining positive relationships with friends, family, and like-minded people can provide a support network and help you find a sense of belonging. Sharing your thoughts and concerns with others who may have similar experiences can be comforting.
 
 3. Focus on personal growth: Instead of fixating on the grand scope of the world, focus on your personal development and growth. Set small goals and work towards them, whether they are related to your career, education, hobbies, or personal well-being. Each step forward can contribute to your sense of achievement and self-worth.
 
 4. Seek meaning through contribution: Consider how you can make a positive impact on the world, even if it feels small. Engaging in acts of kindness, volunteering for causes you care about, or finding ways to support your community can give you a sense of purpose and make a difference, no matter how small.
 
 5. Practice self-care: Prioritize self-care and mental well-being. Take time to engage in activities that help you relax, unwind, and recharge. This can include exercise, meditation, pursuing hobbies, spending time in nature, or seeking professional help if needed.

It's not unusual to question the purpose and meaning of our existence, particularly when faced with a rapidly changing world and societal shifts.

 It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's natural to contemplate the purpose and significance of life. However, it's also crucial to address these concerns and find ways to navigate through them. Here are a few perspectives that may help:
 
 1. Seek purpose and meaning: While the world can be volatile and society ever-changing, you can find purpose by pursuing activities and relationships that bring you fulfillment. Engage in hobbies, causes, or careers that align with your passions and values, as investing in meaningful pursuits can often provide a sense of fulfillment.
 
 2. Focus on personal growth: Rather than getting overwhelmed by the larger world and its uncertainties, concentrate on your own personal development. Set small achievable goals, learn new skills, and work on improving yourself. This mindset can create a sense of progress and give you a feeling of agency over your own life.
 
 3. Connect with others: Building and maintaining meaningful relationships with friends, family, and other supportive individuals can make a significant difference in your life. Connecting with people who share similar concerns can help you gain perspective and find a sense of belonging.
 
 4. Seek assistance if needed: If you're struggling with persistent feelings of sadness or anxiety, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or professional counselor. They can provide support and guidance tailored to your specific situation.

 The sense that ""no matter what you put your effort into, it's not going to matter"" can stem from a feeling of insignificance or a lack of purpose. It's important to remember that finding meaning in life is a deeply personal and subjective journey. What brings purpose to one person's life may not necessarily resonate with another's. What's important is to explore your passions, interests, and values to discover what gives your life a sense of worth and fulfillment.
 
 The world can indeed be volatile and challenging, and societal changes can add to the complexity of navigating life. It's essential to recognize that while you may not have control over certain external factors, you have the ability to shape your own attitudes, actions, and contributions. Consider focusing on what you can control and work towards making a positive impact within your sphere of influence.
 
 Comparing the challenges faced in a modern society with those of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle can be misleading. While the necessities of survival might have provided consistent goals and focus, there were also significant hardships and limitations. It's natural to face emotional struggles even in the absence of immediate physical threats. However, seeking out healthy coping mechanisms and support systems can help you navigate those challenges more effectively.
 
 If your thoughts and feelings of sadness or anxiety persist and impact your daily functioning, it might be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional, counselor, or therapist. They can provide guidance and support tailored to your circumstances and help you develop strategies to manage these emotions.

 It's important to remember that these feelings are valid, and it's okay to question and reflect on the meaning of your life. However, it's also important to seek support and find ways to navigate these emotions constructively. Here are a few suggestions that may help:
 
 1. Connect with others: Talk to someone you trust, such as a family member, friend, or counselor. Sharing your thoughts and concerns with others can provide you with a different perspective and emotional support.
 
 2. Seek professional help: If your feelings of sadness, anxiety, or nihilism persist and interfere with your daily life, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.
 
 3. Explore your passions: Engaging in activities that bring you joy and a sense of purpose can help combat the feeling of pointlessness. It could be pursuing a hobby, volunteering, or focusing on areas that resonate with your interests and values.
 
 4. Practice self-care: Taking care of your mental and physical well-being is crucial. Prioritize activities that promote self-care, such as exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises.

 It's true that the world can be volatile and unpredictable, but it's also important to remember that change and uncertainty are inherent aspects of life. While you can't control everything that happens externally, you can focus on cultivating resilience and adapting to the circumstances.
 
 Finding a sense of purpose doesn't necessarily mean finding a single grand purpose for your entire life. It can involve setting smaller, meaningful goals, nurturing relationships, pursuing hobbies or interests, and contributing to your community. Recognizing the impact you can have, even in seemingly small ways, can be empowering.
 
 Regarding your thoughts on life as a hunter-gatherer, it's important to acknowledge that life in the past had its own challenges and hardships. Each era has its unique set of difficulties and complexities. Romanticizing a different time period may not present an accurate picture of what it was truly like to live during that time.
 
 If you find that these thoughts and feelings persist and significantly interfere with your daily life, it may be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide personalized guidance and support. They can assist you in navigating these emotions and help you develop coping strategies to improve your overall well-being.

However, it's important to remember that your actions can have an impact, even if it may not be immediately evident on a global scale.
 
 Here are a few suggestions to help navigate these thoughts:
 
 1. Find meaning in personal relationships: While the world may seem uncertain, the connections and bonds you have with your family and friends can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Nurture these relationships and find support in sharing your thoughts and concerns with trusted individuals.
 
 2. Pursue personal passions: Engaging in activities you enjoy and pursuing hobbies or interests that bring you joy can help create a sense of purpose. It's not only about the end result but also the journey and personal growth that come with it.
 
 3. Focus on personal growth: Invest in developing your skills and knowledge. Continuous learning and personal growth can provide a sense of progress and open up new opportunities for your future.
 
 4. Make a positive impact: While you may not be able to change the world on a global scale, you can make a difference in your immediate surroundings. Consider getting involved in volunteering or community initiatives that align with your values and allow you to contribute positively.
 
 5. Seek support: If you're struggling with feelings of depression or anxiety, it's important to reach out for professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and assist you in developing coping mechanisms to navigate these emotions.

How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?","I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I want to assure you that you're not alone in having these thoughts. Many people, regardless of age, experience feelings of existential concern and worry about the meaning and purpose of their lives. These thoughts can be particularly common among young adults who are transitioning from adolescence to adulthood and are faced with various responsibilities and uncertainties.
 
 It's important to recognize that these feelings are valid and understandable given the complexity of the world we live in. The constant changes and challenges can be overwhelming, and it's natural to question the value of our efforts and the impact we can make. However, it's crucial not to let these thoughts consume you entirely.
 
 One thing to consider is that finding meaning and purpose in life is a deeply personal journey. While the world may seem volatile and uncertain, there are still opportunities to create meaning and find fulfillment in smaller, more immediate aspects of your life. This could involve cultivating relationships with loved ones, pursuing hobbies or interests that bring you joy, contributing to your community or causes you care about, and setting achievable goals for personal growth.
 
 Addressing mental health concerns like depression and anxiety is also essential. Just because the challenges we face today are different from those of hunter-gatherer times doesn't mean that the emotional struggles we experience aren't valid. Taking care of your mental well-being is crucial, and seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals can be beneficial in navigating these feelings.
 
 Additionally, it may help to consider the bigger picture and recognize that societal change and progress are ongoing processes. While it can be discouraging to witness the problems and injustices in the world, your actions, however small, can contribute to positive change. Engaging in activism or supporting causes that align with your values can provide a sense of purpose and make a meaningful impact, even if it's on a smaller scale.
 
 Remember to be patient with yourself and allow yourself to explore your own path. It's okay to feel uncertain or overwhelmed, but by focusing on the things that bring you joy, building supportive connections, and engaging with the world around you, you can create a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling.",2,0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

 It's not uncommon to question the purpose and meaning of our actions and efforts, especially in the face of a rapidly changing and sometimes turbulent world. The constant exposure to societal changes, global issues, and the pressures of adulthood can be overwhelming.
 
 It's natural to yearn for a simpler time or to romanticize a different way of life, like that of hunter-gatherers. However, it's important to remember that every era has its own challenges and hardships. While the necessities of survival may occupy their time, earlier societies had their own struggles and lacked many of the benefits and comforts of modern life.
 
 The feeling of not being able to make a meaningful impact can stem from a variety of factors, including the scale of global problems, societal pressures, and personal expectations. However, finding purpose and meaning is a personal journey that can differ for each individual. It might be helpful to explore your own passions, interests, and values, and consider how you can align your efforts with those areas that truly matter to you.

 Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that everyone's experience is unique, and people of different ages and backgrounds may have varying perspectives on life. That being said, it's not uncommon for individuals to question the significance of their efforts and the impact they can make in an ever-changing world.

These are valuable aspects of your life that you can cherish and cultivate. By nurturing those relationships and exploring your interests, you can find personal fulfillment and contribute positively to the lives of those around you.

 It's understandable that you may question the significance of your efforts, especially when faced with the ever-changing nature of society. However, it's important to acknowledge that your thoughts and feelings are valid. In our modern world, the demands and pressures can be different from those of hunter-gatherer societies, and comparing the two is not always useful.
 
 It can be helpful to focus on finding personal fulfillment and meaning in your present circumstances. Consider exploring your passions, hobbies, or interests that bring you joy and a sense of purpose. Engaging in activities that align with your values and beliefs can give your life a sense of direction. Additionally, connecting with supportive friends, family, or even seeking professional guidance can offer valuable perspectives and help you navigate through these feelings.
 
 Remember, it's okay to also allow yourself to process and feel sadness, anxiety, and other emotions. Emotions are a natural part of being human, irrespective of the external conditions. It might be beneficial to incorporate self-care practices into your routine, such as exercise, mindfulness, or engaging in activities that promote relaxation and well-being.
 
 If you find that these feelings persist or become overwhelming, it's important to consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide you with further guidance and support. They can help you explore these emotions in a safe and supportive environment.

 While our modern society has provided us with various comforts and opportunities, it's also accompanied by a different set of challenges. It can sometimes be difficult to find purpose and meaning in such a complex world. However, it's important to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to have these thoughts.
 
 It's worth considering that in today's society, our challenges are often more tied to our internal well-being and finding fulfillment. The struggles of daily life may not involve the immediate physical needs of hunting or finding water, but they can be equally demanding on our mental and emotional health.

They can provide guidance and help you explore ways to find your own sense of purpose and fulfillment in life. Remember, it's essential to prioritize your well-being and seek the help you need.

Many people your age experience similar feelings of uncertainty and frustration given the rapidly changing world around us.

 Remember that your feelings are valid, and it's essential to take them seriously. While it's true that society has changed, and our daily struggles may look different now, it doesn't invalidate the emotions you're experiencing. Our minds and emotions can be complex, and it's okay to feel sad or anxious even in our current circumstances. The comparison to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle is understandable, but it's essential to acknowledge that our modern lives come with their own set of difficulties.
 
 If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, it may be helpful to explore healthy coping mechanisms and self-care practices. Engaging in activities that bring you joy, connecting with loved ones, and seeking support from friends or professionals can all be valuable steps towards managing these feelings. Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, and reaching out to a mental health professional can provide additional guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.
