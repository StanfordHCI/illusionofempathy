Sometimes life can feel overwhelming. Despite having many things to be grateful for, it's quite usual to feel lost or disoriented, and it happens to a lot of people, especially at your age. 
 
 You seem to be aware of the dichotomy between our simple beginnings as hunter gatherers, engaged in daily tasks of survival, and where we are now, in a complex society where survival is no longer a worry for many. 
 
 It's important to keep in mind that while it might seem like the world is changing rapidly and things are going wrong, there are also countless signs of hope and progress. It might help you to attempt to narrow your focus onto the jobs or tasks at hand. Ground yourself and assess what needs to be done right now, in this moment. 
 
 Remember, there's no rush. It's okay, and totally normal, to not have all aspects of your life figured out. Society can prioritize success and achievement in a way that might make us feel like we need to constantly be accomplishing. However, it's essential to remember that your worth is not determined by what you do or achieve. 
 
 Try reaching out to those you trust about your feelings as well. Having people around who listen to you and provide support can be very helpful. In addition, consider seeking professional help, such as a therapist or counselor.

It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the pressures and uncertainty of life, even though you have a lot of positives and potential opportunities. You know, the feelings you're experiencing can be quite common among individuals in your age group. Change is a significant and defining characteristic of life, and it can sometimes be hard to prepare for. It's like trying to hit a moving target.
 
 It's also worth noting that romanticizing simpler times, like when we were hunter-gatherers, is entirely understandable. It's easy to find allure in a lifestyle seemingly free of the complexities and stressors of modern society. However, those times had their challenges, too; they were simply different. 
 
 Remember, it's completely okay not to have life figured out yet, especially in your evolving years. The volatility and change you mentioned are evident, but they also lead to growth, evolution, and varieties of opportunities. You might not always see the fruits of your efforts immediately, but that doesn't mean they're wasted.
