Many people, regardless of age, may experience feelings of doubt and a sense of futility in their efforts. However, it's important to remember that perspectives vary and not everyone may share the same feelings.
 
 While it's true that the world can sometimes be volatile and challenging, it's also full of opportunities and potential for growth.

 Comparing modern life to that of hunter-gatherers can be an interesting thought exercise, but it's important to acknowledge that each era has its own unique challenges and stressors. Depression and anxiety can arise from a variety of factors, and minimizing these experiences by romanticizing the past may not provide a complete understanding of mental health.
 
 If you find yourself persistently struggling with feelings of sadness or anxiety, it might be beneficial to reach out to a mental health professional.

It's important to remember that many people go through similar existential thoughts and feelings of uncertainty, especially during transition periods in their lives. While I can't speak for everyone, I can tell you that such thoughts are not uncommon.
 
 First, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to question the meaning or purpose of life. Many philosophers and thinkers throughout history have explored these existential questions. However, it's essential to find ways to cope with or navigate through these feelings.
 
 Here are a few suggestions that may help:
 
 1. Seek support: Talk to someone you trust, such as a family member, friend, or counseling professional, about your thoughts and feelings. They may provide a different perspective or help you work through these thoughts.
 
 2. Find purpose within yourself: Reflect on what brings you joy and what you are passionate about. Sometimes, creating your own sense of purpose can give meaning to your efforts and bring fulfillment, regardless of external factors.
 
 3. Focus on what you can control: While the world may seem uncertain and volatile, there are still things within your control that can make a positive difference in your life and the lives of others. Set small achievable goals, develop healthy routines, and cultivate relationships that bring you joy.
 
 4. Practice gratitude: Look for the things in your life that you are grateful for, such as your job, family, friends, and opportunities. Focusing on gratitude can help shift your perspective and bring a sense of contentment.
 
 5. Consider engaging in activities that align with your values: Exploring activities that allow you to make a positive impact or contribute to causes you care about can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

The sense that your efforts may not matter, especially in a world that seems volatile and ever-changing, can be overwhelming.
 
 Firstly, it's essential to recognize that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people, regardless of age, can relate to existential thoughts and concerns about the uncertainty of the future. However, it's important to remember that perspectives can change over time, and your current mindset may evolve as you gain new experiences and insights.
 
 It's also helpful to consider that the world and society are constantly evolving. While change can be challenging, it also brings opportunities for growth and progress. Despite the tumultuous nature of the world, there are still aspects that you can have an impact on. Whether it's through your job, relationships, or personal passions, your actions and choices can make a difference, even in small ways.
 
 Feeling saddened by the complexities of modern life is also understandable. Comparing our circumstances to those of hunter-gatherers is an interesting thought experiment, but it's important to acknowledge that our world is different now, and mental health issues are a real concern. It's crucial to prioritize your well-being and seek support if needed. Therapy, counseling, or talking to trusted friends or family members can help provide guidance and perspective during challenging times.
 
 Remember, it's okay to have these thoughts and feelings, but try keeping an open mind and remain hopeful for the future. Find activities or hobbies that bring you joy and purpose.

How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's not uncommon for young adults to question the meaning and purpose of their lives, especially in a world that can feel volatile and uncertain. It's important to remember that you're not alone in these feelings, and many people experience similar thoughts and concerns.
 
 The first thing I would suggest is reaching out to someone you trust, like a close friend or family member, to talk about how you're feeling. Having someone to listen and support you can be incredibly helpful. They may also be able to offer a different perspective or share their own experiences.
 
 Additionally, consider seeking help from a mental health professional, like a counselor or therapist. They can provide you with techniques and strategies to cope with these thoughts and help you develop a more positive and meaningful outlook on life. They can also help you explore your values and interests, which can give you a sense of purpose.
 
 Remember that finding meaning in life is an ongoing process, and it's normal to question things from time to time. It can be helpful to set small, achievable goals that align with your values, and to focus on the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Taking care of your mental and physical health is also crucial, as it can greatly impact your overall well-being.
 
 Lastly, it's important to be patient with yourself. Life can be challenging, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed at times. Reach out for support, take things one step at a time, and remember that there are resources and people available to help you through difficult periods.",2,0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

It's not uncommon for people your age to question the meaning or purpose of life, especially when faced with the complexities and challenges of our modern world. However, it's important to remember that your feelings are valid and that many people have struggled with similar thoughts.
 
 It may be helpful to recognize that these existential thoughts can be a natural part of the human experience, especially during periods of transition and change. It's also worth noting that society constantly evolves, and while change can be challenging, it also brings new opportunities and pathways to explore.
 
 If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by these thoughts, it might be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional. They can provide support, guidance, and help you develop coping strategies for managing these feelings. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength, and you don't have to face these challenges alone.
 
 Taking care of your mental health is essential. Engaging in hobbies, maintaining social connections, and practicing self-care are all valuable ways to promote well-being and find purpose in your daily life.

Many people, including those in your age group, may experience similar thoughts and concerns. However, it's also important to recognize that these feelings are subjective and can vary from person to person.
 
 It's essential to reach out for support when you're feeling this way. Talking to friends, family, or even seeking professional help can be beneficial in gaining a better understanding of your emotions and exploring ways to find meaning in life. Remember that you don't have to face these thoughts alone.
 
 While it's true that life in contemporary society can be complex and stressful, it's important not to idealize the past. Every era has its own challenges, and while hunting for survival may have provided a clear sense of purpose, it also came with its own struggles. Additionally, the world constantly evolves, and adapting to change is an essential part of life.
 
 Finding purpose and meaning often requires introspection and exploring your own values and interests. Engaging in activities that align with your passions, contributing to your community, cultivating relationships, and having a positive impact can all help provide a sense of fulfillment. Remember, it is okay to seek support and take the time you need to prioritize your mental well-being.",1,0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

Many people your age experience these contemplations about the meaning and purpose of life.
 
 The current state of the world, combined with the changing nature of society, can certainly contribute to those feelings. The world can feel overwhelming and unpredictable, leading to a sense of hopelessness at times.
 
 It's important to remember that each person's experience is unique, and while some individuals may feel the same way as you do, others may not. It's normal to have ups and downs and to question the purpose of your efforts.
 
 While it's true that life as a hunter-gatherer might have been simpler in some ways, it's also important to recognize the advantages and opportunities that you have in today's world. Society has progressed in many aspects, providing a range of possibilities for personal and professional growth.
