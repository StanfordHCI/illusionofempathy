It must have been extremely traumatic and it's completely understandable that you're feeling the way you are. Experiencing something as horrific as a school shooting can leave long-lasting emotional effects.
 
 In times like these, it can be incredibly difficult to comprehend why such tragic events occur and why some are spared while others are not. It's important to acknowledge your survivor's guilt and the emotions that come along with it. Remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to not have all the answers right now.
 
 During times of intense emotional turmoil, it can be helpful to speak with someone who can provide support and guidance, such as a therapist, counselor, or a trusted individual in your life. They can help you process your emotions, navigate through the trauma you've experienced, and develop coping mechanisms that can assist you in your healing journey.
 
 Additionally, taking care of yourself physically is important too. Engaging in activities that bring you comfort and practicing self-care can help alleviate some of the emotional burden you're carrying. This may include giving yourself permission to grieve, engaging in relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, and seeking solace in the support of loved ones.

It's completely understandable that such a traumatic event would have a profound impact on you. The aftermath of a tragedy can leave us feeling overwhelmed, helpless, and questioning our own survival.
 
 Please know that what you're feeling is a natural response to an extremely distressing situation. It can be difficult to make sense of why some people survive while others don't, and the feelings of guilt can be especially challenging to process. It's important to remember that your response is valid, and it's okay to struggle with these emotions.
 
 During this difficult time, it might help to reach out for support. Consider speaking with a mental health professional who can help you navigate through the trauma and emotions. They can provide you with coping strategies, and a safe space to express your thoughts and feelings.
 
 Additionally, connecting with others who have experienced similar situations, either in person or through support groups online, can be comforting. Sharing your stories, concerns, and fears with people who understand can often provide a sense of understanding and validation.
 
 Remember that healing takes time, and everyone's journey is unique. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve and process your emotions at your own pace. If you feel overwhelmed and need immediate help, please reach out to a helpline or emergency services in your area.

 Guilt and survivor's guilt are common feelings that can arise when you have been through a traumatic event while others have suffered. It's important to remember that it's not your fault and that you did what you could to stay safe. It's a natural human response to question why some individuals survive while others do not, but it's not something that can be easily answered.
 
 Right now, it's crucial to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. It's understandable that you may be having difficulty sleeping, eating, and finding motivation. Seek support from trusted friends, family members, or professionals who can provide a safe space for you to process your feelings. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you navigate through this difficult time.
 
 Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to not have all the answers right now. Be kind and patient with yourself as you go through this healing process. Lean on your support system, engage in self-care activities that bring you comfort, and allow yourself to grieve and process your emotions at your own pace.
