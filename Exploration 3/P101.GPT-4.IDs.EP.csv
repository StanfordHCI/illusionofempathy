It's absolutely devastating and it's only natural to be feeling this way after such a traumatic event. It's OK to be confused, scared, and upset. It's important that you reach out and share your feelings, so thank you for being brave and doing just that.
 
 It's also important to let yourself grieve, it's a part of the healing process. You've experienced a traumatic event and it's crucial that you seek professional help. A trauma counselor or a professional therapist would be able to provide you with some valuable tools to cope with what you're going through. 
 
 You might also find it helpful to reach out to your school, as they likely have resources available to you, like counseling services. They can provide you with immediate outreach and connect you with further support.
 
 It's great that you're reaching out here online, but please make sure to reach out to those close to you, too, like friends and family. Often, they may not know how to help or what to say, but just having them there could help.
 
 Remember, it's okay not to be okay right now. Your feelings are valid, and it's most important to process them at your own pace. You survived, and it's natural to question why, but there's no expectation for you to have any of the answers right now. Try to focus on just one day at a time, even one moment at a time.
 
 Please, don't hesitate to reach out to someone who can help, like a counselor, a trusted teacher, or even a hotline like the National Crisis Text Line (you can text them at 741741 any time) or the American Psychological Association's Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990. You're not alone.
