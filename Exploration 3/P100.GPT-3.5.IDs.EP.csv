Many people in your age group experience similar thoughts and feelings of existential uncertainty. The rapidly changing world and the challenges we face can sometimes be overwhelming. It's important to remember that it's natural to question the purpose and meaning of life.
 
 While I cannot offer a definitive answer, I can encourage you to try reframing your perspective. Instead of focusing on the ultimate purpose of life, you can find meaning in the small moments, personal connections, and the things you enjoy. It might be helpful to explore activities or hobbies that bring you joy and provide a sense of purpose.
 
 Remember that your feelings of sadness and anxiety are valid, regardless of the circumstances we find ourselves in. The demands and pressures of our modern world can take a toll on our mental health. It doesn't mean you're weak or flawed for experiencing these emotions. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it could be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.
 
 Don't hesitate to lean on your support system as well - your loving family and friends who care deeply about you. Opening up and discussing your thoughts with them may provide you with a different perspective or some reassurance.
 
 Lastly, it's important to prioritize self-care. Taking care of your physical and mental well-being can greatly contribute to your overall happiness. Engaging in activities such as exercising, practicing mindfulness, and getting enough sleep can help improve your mood and manage anxiety.
