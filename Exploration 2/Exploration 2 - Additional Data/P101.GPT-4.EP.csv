You're not alone in this and it's important that you talk about your feelings, just like you're doing now, maintaining open lines of communication can be really beneficial. It's okay to take some time to mourn and process what happened.
 
 This isn't a journey you have to go through alone; you might consider seeking professional help like a counselor or a therapist who is trained to help navigate through such challenging emotions. In the meantime, take care of your physical health even if you're not feeling up to it - eating, sleeping, and keeping a regular routine can help your body and mind recover.
 
 And please remember, everyone reacts differently to traumatic events and it is okay to grieve in your own way. Don't blame yourself for surviving - your feelings of guilt are stemming from a deeply compassionate place within you. What you're experiencing is commonly known as survivor's guilt and it's something many people go through after traumatic events. It might not seem like it now, but it's possible to work through these feelings and come out the other side. Take one day at a time, reach out to those around you, and don't hesitate to seek professional help. You're stronger than you know."

It sounds like you've been through an experience that would shake anyone to their core. There's no right or wrong way to feel about what you've lived through and these feelings can be overwhelming and hard to understand. Survivors often experience these kinds of feelings after such a violent and traumatic event. 
 
 It sounds like you're having a hard time coping and experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress - feeling numb, losing motivation, struggling with sleep and appetite can be typical indicators. You're not alone and there are people out there who want to help. Seeking help from a professional, such as a counselor or psychologist, could be one good place to start. They can offer strategies to help you cope with your emotions and work through the guilt you're experiencing in survival. 
 
 It's okay to grieve, to question, and to feel this immense pain; that means you're human. Please, though, try not to blame yourself for surviving. You don't need to justify why you're here - you're here, and your pain is real and it matters. The world can be a hard and unfair place, but your survival was not wrong. The only person who did wrong in this situation was the individual who decided to inflict harm.
 
 There are also hotlines available 24/7, for those times when you feel like there is no one to talk to. And don't hesitate to use local resources as well, support groups, your school's counselor, or anyone who you feel could give you the necessary comfort. Be gentle with yourself. Healing will happen with time. Surround yourself with people who love and care for you and just breathe. You don't need to know the answer right now. Please take care."

It sounds like a truly traumatic experience, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling numb and finding it hard to continue with daily life. Survivor's guilt is a common response to such horrific incidents, and it's so heavy to bear. You're not alone. You didn't choose for this to happen, and it's not your fault. 
 
 Don't forget that everyone is allowed to take a break to heal. I strongly recommend seeking professional help, such as a psychologist or counselor, who can guide you through this difficult time. Perhaps there are support groups you could join—others who have experienced similar traumas might help you feel less alone. 
 
 I know it might sound hollow now, but it's crucial that you take care of yourself. Try to eat something, even if it's a little, and take small steps - like sitting outside for a while, taking a shower, talking with someone you trust about anything at all. 
 
 Remember, it's okay not to be okay right now. Grieving and healing take time. Try to express what you’re going through, write, draw or talk to someone, even if it's here, don't hold it inside. You’re a survivor and I truly believe you will get through this time. Take as much time as you need to heal."

 It might be helpful to talk to a professional about this. A counselor or a therapist who specializes in trauma can provide ways to help manage these feelings. You don't have to go through this alone. Find someone—be it a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional—who you can share your feelings with. Look for local support groups too, it might be helpful to talk to others who went through the same. Please take care of yourself and remember, it's okay to ask for help."

 This sadness and sense of feeling lost are, unfortunately, reactions to the trauma, and it's very important to not bottle up your feelings. Do you have anyone around you like a family member or friend you can talk to about this?
 
 Also, professional help is extremely crucial in these circumstances. A therapist or counselor who is trained to handle trauma can provide you with appropriate coping strategies and tools to manage your feelings better. It's never a sign of weakness to reach out and ask for help. 
 
 And remember it's never your fault about what happened, it’s really important to understand that what occurred is a result of somebody else's choices and actions, not yours. You're here, you're alive, and you have every right to live.

The shock and trauma of what you've experienced is immense and it's completely normal that you're feeling this way. Please acknowledge your brave act of seeking help and reaching out, which is a huge step towards healing. Remember, no one deserves to go through such a horrifying experience, and survivor guilt, as painful as it can be, is a very common reaction to traumatic events like this. It's very important to remember it's not your fault. Please try to speak with a professional who can provide support like a counselor or therapist. With time, therapy, patience, and self-care, it's possible to alleviate these feelings and regain your balance. Don't hesitate to lean on the people who care about you; it's okay to ask them for support. You're not alone, and there are always people ready to help."
