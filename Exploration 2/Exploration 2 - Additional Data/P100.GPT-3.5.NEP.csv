 Feeling like one's efforts may not matter or that the world is volatile can be overwhelming. However, it's important to remember that while the world may have its challenges, there are still meaningful experiences and connections to be found within it.
 
 It's also worth noting that comparing our present lives to a hypothetical hunter-gatherer lifestyle can oversimplify the complexities of our modern existence. While life back then had its own struggles, it wouldn't eliminate emotions like depression or anxiety. Mental health issues can arise from various sources, including biological factors, personal circumstances, and societal changes.

It's not uncommon for people to experience existential questions or a sense of meaninglessness at different points in their lives. It's important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, and what you're feeling may not be the same for everyone in your age group.
 
 Feeling uncertain about the future and questioning the purpose of your efforts can be challenging, especially when the world is seemingly volatile and constantly changing. These feelings can be overwhelming, but it's essential to recognize that you're not alone in experiencing them.
 
 It may be helpful to talk to someone you trust about what you're feeling, such as a close friend, family member, or a mental health professional. They can offer support, provide different perspectives, and assist you in finding healthy ways to cope with these thoughts.
 
 Remember, it's okay to take care of your mental and emotional well-being. Make self-care a priority and consider engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Additionally, exploring your interests, setting personal goals, or finding ways to contribute positively to your community can help give your life a sense of purpose.
 
 If you find that these thoughts become persistent, interfere with your daily functioning, or cause significant distress, I strongly encourage you to seek professional help. Mental health professionals are trained to provide guidance and assistance in navigating these types of challenges."
