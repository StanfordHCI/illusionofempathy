It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings, and it's understandable that you're feeling a mixture of regret, guilt, and shame. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we learn from them and grow that really matters.
 
 It seems like this experience has caused you a great deal of distress, and that is completely valid. It can be overwhelming when our actions don't align with our personal values and beliefs. It's important to be kind to yourself during this process and remember that seeking forgiveness and reflecting on your feelings are important steps towards healing.
 
 Finding peace may take time, and it might be helpful to consider reaching out to a therapist or a support group who can provide guidance during this difficult period. They can provide a safe space to discuss your emotions and help you navigate through this experience. Remember, you are not alone in your feelings and seeking support is a sign of strength.
 
 It's also important to give yourself permission to make amends if you feel it is appropriate. Apologizing to the person you've already reached out to shows that you are taking responsibility for your actions. However, it's essential to respect their response and understand that it may not completely alleviate your own feelings of guilt.
 
 Lastly, know that your past does not define your worth as a person. It may take time and effort, but it is possible to heal, grow, and find happiness again in your life. Please take care of yourself and reach out if you need someone to talk to."

 It's understandable that your divorce and the subsequent events triggered a spiral for you emotionally. It takes time to heal from such experiences, and it's normal to struggle with feelings of self-worth during difficult times.

Sharing your burden can help alleviate the weight on your shoulders and provide you with a fresh perspective.
 
 Aside from seeking support, also consider engaging in self-care activities that promote healing, such as practicing mindfulness, engaging in hobbies, or finding healthy outlets to express your emotions. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through this process, and to focus on self-forgiveness.
