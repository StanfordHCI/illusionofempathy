You're at a point in your life where you're becoming more aware of the world around you and are acutely aware of the systemic problems in society. It's normal to feel small and insignificant sometimes.
 
 It's important to remember that everyone has a unique role in this universe and that even small actions or decisions can have profound effects. You have more power to affect positive change than you might think. You're also not alone in your feelings. Many people from all walks of life still grapple with these kinds of existential questions, and it's part of being human.
 
 If you don't feel that your current lifestyle provides you with the challenge, stimulation or fulfillment you need, there are ways to change that. Various outdoor and survival activities might create a sense of urgency and physical challenge like what you seem to crave. You might even consider a career change into a field you believe will benefit society. 
 
 In addition, you may want to consider seeking help from a mental health professional. Mental health issues like depression and anxiety can make life seem meaningless, even when you objectively have a lot going for you. But these are treatable conditions, and there are many resources available to help you cope with these feelings.
 
 Lastly, it's okay to feel directionless at times. Remember that life is a journey and you don't need to have all the answers right now. Your purpose and passions might become clearer with time and introspection."

There's a lot of emotional turmoil when you understand the realities of life, especially when it comes to the flaws and imperfect nature of our global society.
 
 Firstly, it's important to know, you're not alone in experiencing these feelings. Many are going through this phase of reevaluating the meaning and purpose of life. 
 
 From a Buddhist perspective, life is inherently characterized by suffering or dissatisfaction – the First Noble Truth. But importantly, there is a path out of this suffering, and that is the main aim of the Buddhist practice: the Eightfold Path. This path includes right mindfulness and right concentration, two components that focus on training your mind to be present and mindful at all times.
 
 Remember that all human pursuits are temporary and fleeting by nature; that's what makes them so special. You could find more satisfaction in life by focusing on the process of things rather than always thinking about their potential results or 'end'. 
 
 Also, don't underestimate the value of your job, family, and friends. They are your support system, the ones who give you strength when you need it. The love, care, and friendship they offer are invaluable and can give your life a deep sense of meaning.
 
 Lastly, if these feelings persist, it may be helpful to consider professional help such as a therapist or counselor. There is no shame in reaching out when you need it. Keep on meditating, seek wisdom, live in the present, and continue spreading love and happiness. You are more than the fleeting thoughts of existential crisis."

This sort of self-reflection and existential concern often signals that you are maturing and wrestling with greater life questions. Much of this can stem from overwhelming awareness of the imperfections of the world in which we live, as well as the societal pressures and uncertainty of the future.
 
 What you are feeling could be existential depression. It can be triggered by internal factors such as reflection on certain existential issues such as death, freedom, and the meaning of life. It might seem odd for people who seem to have everything going for them to feel this way, but existential depression doesn't discriminate: it can affect anyone of any circumstance, age, or background.
 
 It could be helpful to find a professional therapist or a counselor to talk over these feelings with. In addition, talking about your feelings with someone you trust in your life might provide some relief. This could be a good friend, a family member, a religious or spiritual counselor, or someone else you feel comfortable with.
 
 Take some time for you as well - rest, exercise, engage in a hobby - and try to explore the feelings you are experiencing rather than repress them or feel guilty about having them. Lastly, try to think about your core values and what brings you joy, satisfaction, and a sense of purpose. 
 
 Always remember that it is okay to feel unsure or anxious about the future - many people do, especially during times of significant change or uncertainty. With time and patience, you will come to find your own meaning and purpose in life."

 It's important to note that it's perfectly okay to feel this way, but it's also crucial to reach out to someone who can provide professional help, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide perspective and teach strategies to cope with these feelings. 
 
 Everyone's life has a different purpose and meaning, and our path in finding that meaning differs greatly too. Sometimes the pressures and changes in modern society can feel overwhelming, but they do not diminish the value of our lives.
