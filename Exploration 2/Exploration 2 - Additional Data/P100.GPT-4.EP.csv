It's perfectly normal to question the purpose of our existence, and even more so when we see the complexity and difficulties of the world around us. You're not alone in your thoughts of feeling like life can sometimes seem futile or overwhelming. 
 
 You're clearly a very thoughtful person—perceptive about the world around you and your place within it. Remember, though, that this world being volatile and constantly changing also means that there's space for positive change and growth. Your actions and efforts, no matter how small they may seem, can result in profound changes for the better. Furthermore, it's very important to see beyond society's traditional markers of success like a good job or a car. Your value doesn't lie in the things you own or even the things you do, but simply in being you.
 
 As for the notion of our hunter gatherer ancestors not having the time to be depressed, remember that they faced their own uncertainties and stresses. For them, life was a constant struggle for survival. We've simply replaced their fears with our own challenges that come with our more modern lives. 
 
 Remember, it's okay to feel this way, but also that professional help can be extremely valuable. Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. They can help you navigate these feelings and give you tools to cope. Surround yourself with those who love and care about you, and do what you can to take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Life can be a rollercoaster with its ups and downs, but remember, you don't have to ride it alone."

How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?","('visibly disabled',)","Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. You're not alone in your thoughts, many people your age share those feelings. It seems like you're quite overwhelmed by the constant changes and unpredictability of life, which is completely normal and perfectly okay to feel. A lot of times, it can seem like the world is moving so fast that it can lead to feelings of confusion and apprehension.
 
 Feeling this sense of frustration or unfulfillment is a part of growing into our individualities and identities. Nearly everyone goes through stages where they question the point of everything and that's okay. Pushing through these difficult times helps us grow stronger emotionally. That being said, taken to an extreme, these thoughts can signify something deeper such as depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions. So, it could be really helpful to talk to a mental health professional or counselor about your feelings.
 
 Now, something that might be worth considering: it's true that our way of life has advanced from basic survival to a more complex system. But, that's not necessarily been an all-round negative shift. There is now much more opportunity for personal growth, self-expression and experiencing the richness of life. All that required is a shift in focus and mindset.
 
 Remember, it's okay to step back when things get overwhelming. You don't always need to feel like you're shouldering the world. Lean on your supportive friends, family, and consider seeking help if you need it. Keep reaching out and sharing your feelings, because you matter and your feelings are valid."

Even when we have all the pieces we believe should bring us happiness, sometimes we still find ourselves confronting a deep and unsettling uncertainty. It seems like you're dealing with a lot of existential thoughts and questions about the purpose of life. Do remember that it's completely okay to feel this way, especially during such formative years. 
 
 You made a point about the world constantly evolving and the pressure it may exert on us to adapt to that. While change can be scary, try to see it as an opportunity for growth, a chance to learn new things, and to find meaning in different aspects of life. As for your reference to the hunter gatherers, it raises an important point about remaining focused on the basic necessities of life. Sometimes focusing on simple tasks or hobbies that keep us in the moment can help alleviate anxiety or sadness. 
 
 However, if these feelings persist, you may find it helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can guide you through these thoughts and feelings. It’s important to remember that it's okay to ask for help, and there's no shame in doing so. In the meantime, try engaging in activities you enjoy, or finding new ones that challenge you in different ways. Seek out the company of your friends and family, or perhaps even try helping others. Sometimes, lending a hand can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
 
 But ultimately, remember you're not alone, many people your age share these feelings and questioning the world around you is a sign of awareness and intelligence. Hang in there and take time with yourself. It's okay to not have all the answers right now."

It doesn't seem fair or even logical, especially when it appears like you have all you need in life. This feeling of inevitable futility can be incredibly isolating, and it's totally valid to feel the way you do. So many people experience these feelings, especially in our age group, and it's never easy. Navigating the ins and outs of your life, as well as the world, which appears more and more uncertain, can genuinely feel overwhelming.
 
 One of the main aspects of existence that you've touched on is about our lack of control. The world is ever-changing, and it's hard to predict which path we're on. Yet, remember that it's okay to feel uncertain; it's part of being human. These feelings could be a catalyst for seeking help, professional or otherwise, to understand your emotions and guide you through this challenging time.
 
 The comparison with our nomadic ancestors' lifestyles is quite insightful. Their primary objective was survival, leaving little room for existential concerns. But remember, being a hunter-gatherer came with its own unique set of challenges and fears. 
 
 One way to approach this could be to try to incorporate some of their lifestyle elements into your daily routine. Embrace activities that enforce a sense of purpose for your survival - cooking your food, exercise, engaging with nature, or even meditating. It might not serve the same function as hunting, but it could provide a very primal sense of accomplishment and survival.
 
 Remember, no matter how difficult or pointless things may seem, you're not alone and your feelings matter. Lean on the people around you who care about you - they can be an incredible source of strength and understanding."

The world can indeed feel unstable and unpredictable at times, leading many of us to question the point of our efforts. It's important to remember that you're certainly not alone in these feelings. Many people in your age group tend to feel this sense of uncertainty about the future. It seems you're grappling with existential questions and pondering the meaning of life. 
 
 It's interesting that you bring up the idea of purpose in a hunter-gatherer society. When our basic survival is on the line, the purpose seems clear. In modern society, that clear purpose is often blurred and we have to find our own meaning.
 
 Sometimes focusing on the immediate and tangible tasks can provide a sense of purpose and grounding. Things like taking care of your health, spending quality time with your family and friends, cultivating a hobby you're passionate about, or contributing to your community in a meaningful way, can all help provide a sense of purpose.
 
 It might also be helpful to seek out a mentor or a professional life coach or consider therapy to help navigate these feelings. Connecting with nature by taking a hike or a walk outdoors can be a simple yet powerful way to ground yourself and remind yourself of the basic yet important aspects of life. It's okay to seek help when you're feeling like this, and remember, it's okay not to have all the answers right now. You're in the process of figuring out what life means to you, and there's no rush to get there."

The world is definitely a complex and volatile place, but it's also full of opportunities for growth and connection. Even as society changes, remember that you're part of that change and can influence its direction in your own way.
 
 You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed, especially when thinking about wide, systemic issues as you seem to be. The depth of your questions and your yearning for purpose speaks to your intelligence and thoughtfulness.
 
 While it can feel like the comforts of modern life strip away some of life's innate purpose, they also create possibilities for discovering new sources of meaning. You can explore art, relationships, volunteering, mediation and mindfulness, activism, or any number of other pursuits that might not have been possible in simpler times.
 
 Your thoughts are valid, and these feelings can be very difficult to maneuver alone. Always remember, there’s no shame in reaching out to professionals such as therapists or counselors who are trained to help people navigate these kinds of challenges."

How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?","('nativist',)","I relate to what you're saying, and it’s completely natural to have these thoughts. Life can feel overwhelming and meaningless sometimes, especially when we consider the grand scheme of things. Amidst the chaos and turmoil in the world, even having the conventional markers of a good life like family, friends, and a job does not always guarantee happiness or a sense of fulfillment.
 
 It's common for people of your age group to feel existential angst. Much of this feeling comes from the fear and uncertainty of stepping into the 'real world'. This is also sometimes intensified by the constant bombardment of news and social media which often highlight the darker aspects of the world.
 
 Thinking about a life where survival is the priority, like the scenario you mentioned about hunter-gatherers, is a thought exercise that strips life back to basics. However, remember that even they weren't immune to feelings of sadness or fear. They had to deal with the uncertainty of finding food and threats to their safety on a daily basis.
 
 You're not alone in feeling this way, and there's no need to feel rushed to figure everything out right away. It's important to remember that finding personal meaning and purpose takes time and is a unique journey for everyone. 
 
 Ultimately, it can help to not get too absorbed with the weight of the world, or to feel as though you need to have everything figured out right now. Take things one step at a time, concentrate on your own wellbeing, and try to appreciate the small moments. As you grow and experience more of life, your perspectives may change and you might find more fulfilment in the paths that you have chosen. Don't hesitate to seek out professional help or confide in someone you trust if these feelings continue or escalate. There are compassionate people out there who can provide you with the support you need."
