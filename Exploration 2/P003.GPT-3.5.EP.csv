It's brave of you to acknowledge this concern and seek guidance. It's essential to approach healthcare as a collaborative and inclusive process, respecting the dignity and worth of every individual involved.
 
 Firstly, it's worth remembering that healthcare providers are committed to treating all patients with respect, regardless of their personal beliefs or biases. However, every interaction should be based on mutual respect and understanding. Here are a few suggestions for navigating your healthcare journey:
 
 1. Reflect and challenge your beliefs: Take the time to reflect on your racist thoughts and their origins. Educate yourself about diversity, equity, and inclusion. Try to challenge and unlearn these beliefs to foster a more accepting and inclusive mindset.
 
 2. Open and honest communication: When engaging with healthcare professionals, focus on clear, honest communication about your physical health conditions. Try to provide necessary information about your symptoms, medical history, and concerns openly. Building trust through communication is crucial.
 
 3. Treat others with respect: Regardless of personal biases, it's vital to treat every healthcare professional, staff member, or fellow patient respectfully. Be conscious of your language, actions, and attitudes during interactions to foster a positive and inclusive environment.
 
 4. Build a support system: Surround yourself with people who will support you throughout your healthcare journey. Reach out to friends, family, or support groups who can provide encouragement and guidance. Having a support system can help alleviate any concerns you may have about potential discrimination.
 
 5. Advocate for yourself: Remember that you have the right to receive equal and fair treatment in healthcare. If you ever feel discriminated against, mistreated, or misunderstood, it's important to speak up. Seek assistance from patient advocacy groups or consult with a healthcare professional you trust.
 
 Remember, everyone deserves access to quality healthcare, free from discrimination. By working on yourself and striving for inclusivity, you can positively contribute to your own healthcare journey.

Communicate openly and honestly about the changes you would like to make and any physical limitations you may have.
